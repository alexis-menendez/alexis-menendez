## ✧ About

### Journey
I didn’t take the usual path into tech. I grew up with instability and learned early how to survive, adapt under pressure, and take responsibility when no one else would. I left home at 15, started working, and eventually enrolled in a welding and blacksmithing program. From there, my path was shaped by grit, curiosity, and a deep need to build a life that was truly mine.

When I started that program, I had never touched a power tool. I was terrified, but I showed up anyway. Welding taught me more than how to shape metal; it showed me I was strong, brave, and capable of learning what once felt impossible. It gave me a language for resilience, turning heat and pressure into something that could hold weight.

I eventually set aside the torch to put myself through college, pursuing a degree in psychology. I was drawn to how early experiences shape the brain and behavior, how people heal, and how systems can either fail or support that process. That passion led me to therapeutic psychedelics and neuropsychology, where science, healing, and social justice meet.

To support myself through school, I enrolled in a full-stack bootcamp as a means to an end. But I’ve been surprised by how much I enjoy it. Programming is both creative and intellectually rich, giving me new ways to solve problems and build meaningful tools. Now I’m working to grow my technical skills alongside my research, aiming to develop a holistic skill set that connects the emotional with the analytical, the scientific with the structural.

### Now
I’m:
- Graduating with my Associates in Psychology
- Wrapping up a rigorous coding bootcamp at Rice University
- Building **InnerOrbit**, a space-themed mental wellness app with the help of two other junior developers
- Preparing to move to Portland, Oregon and begin the next chapter of my career and academic journey

### Fun Facts & Passions
- I’m passionate about both science and art, often blending the two in projects that explore cognition, emotion, and environment.
- I deeply value quiet, reflective experiences in nature and draw inspiration from landscapes like the Texas plains (where I was born) and the shores of Puerto Rico (where my family is from).
- I’ve worked in everything from nursing homes to college student services to metal sculpture studios, and I bring a multidisciplinary lens to all my work.
- Outside of coding, I sculpt, weld, paint, garden, dance (West Coast Swing & Fusion!), and craft wearable art.

### Principles I Code By

My approach to design and development is guided by three core beliefs:

#### 1. The Function of Form
> *“Form follows function — that has been misunderstood. Form and function should be one, joined in a spiritual union.”*
> *― Frank Lloyd Wright*

Design is not what you add after the “real work” is done. I believe that good design *is* good function. A product should feel intuitive, welcoming—even beautiful. Because beauty isn’t indulgent—it builds trust. It invites use. Form isn’t simply decoration, it’s how function makes itself known. 

#### 2. Contemplative Construction
> *“...but more often he would be alone, feeling through a certain quick instinct, which was almost a divination, that the secrets of art are best learned in secret, and that Beauty, like Wisdom, loves the lonely worshiper.”*
>  *― Oscar Wilde, The Happy Prince and Other Tales*

There’s a kind of understanding that only solitude makes possible. I believe in reflection as part of the process. Some insights arrive best in stillness, unshaped by noise and the pressure to perform. But I don’t stay in the quiet forever. Solitude is where the idea starts, collaboration is where it comes to life.

#### 3. Collective Craft
> *“No one is born fully-formed: it is through self-experience in the world that we become what we are.”*
>  *― Paulo Freire*

Programming is often imagined as a solitary pursuit, but great work isn't built alone. It’s shaped in dialogue, strengthened by collaboration, and brought to life through the contributions of many minds. I don’t build in a vacuum. Code reviews aren’t critique, they’re how we scale insight and enable us to build things better and bigger than we ever could have on our own.

### Skills & Strengths

My greatest strengths lie in how I approach problems, people, and projects. Here are the skills I bring to every team and codebase:

- **Creative Problem Solving** – I approach challenges with curiosity and persistence, often drawing from diverse disciplines like art, psychology, and fabrication to find thoughtful, human-centered solutions.
- **Collaboration & Communication** – Whether working in teams or mentoring peers, I prioritize clarity, empathy, and active listening. I know how to ask the right questions and how to translate complexity into shared understanding.
- **Project Ownership & Leadership** – I’m proactive and self-directed, often stepping into leadership roles to set direction, coordinate tasks, and support team alignment. I take initiative, manage my time well, and follow through on tasks with accountability and pride in my work.
- **UI/UX Sensibility** – With a background in visual arts and psychology, I bring a unique perspective to user interfaces, balancing aesthetic design with intuitive functionality and accessibility.
- **Documentation & Organization** – I excel at creating clear, accessible documentation for both codebases and team processes. From README files to team onboarding guides, I bring structure and clarity that helps everyone stay aligned and move faster.
- **Resilience & Adaptability** – I thrive in fast-paced, evolving environments. From learning power tools with zero experience to diving into backend systems mid-project, I meet challenges with resourcefulness and grit.
- **Systems Thinking** – I see the bigger picture — how frontend connects to backend, how users interact with features, and how small design decisions affect the larger system. This helps me build intentional, scalable solutions.
