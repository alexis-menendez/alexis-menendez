## About

### Journey
I didn’t arrive at tech by the usual path. I grew up navigating instability, and by the time I was a teenager, I had already learned what it meant to survive — to problem-solve under pressure, to adapt quickly, and to take responsibility when no one else would. I left home at 15 and began working, eventually enrolling in a welding and blacksmithing program. What followed was a winding road shaped by grit, curiosity, and the determination to build a life on my own terms.

When I started that program, I had never used a power tool in my life. I was terrified — but I showed up anyway. Welding taught me more than fabrication or forge work; it taught me that I was strong, brave, and capable of learning things that once felt impossible. It gave me a language for resilience — a way to turn heat and pressure into structure, into something that could hold weight.

Eventually, I set aside the torch to put myself through college, pursuing a degree in psychology. I was drawn to understanding how early experiences shape the brain and behavior — how people heal, and how systems can fail or uplift that process. That passion steered my interests towards therapeutic psychedelics and neuropsychology, where science, healing, and social justice intersect.

To support myself while continuing my academic path, I enrolled in a full-stack programming bootcamp — originally as a means to an end. But I’ve been surprised and thrilled to discover how much I enjoy the work. I find programming to be deeply creative and intellectually satisfying, offering new ways to solve problems and build meaningful tools. Now, I’m exploring how I can deepen my technical skills while continuing my research interests, with the long-term goal of developing a comprehensive, holistic skill set that bridges the emotional and the analytical, the scientific and the structural.

### Now
I’m:
- Graduating with my Associates in Psychology
- Wrapping up a rigorous coding bootcamp at Rice University
- Building **InnerOrbit**, a space-themed mental wellness app with the help of two other junior developers
- Preparing to move to Portland, Oregon and begin the next chapter of my career and academic journey

### Fun Facts & Passions
- I’m passionate about both science and art, often blending the two in projects that explore cognition, emotion, and environment.
- I deeply value quiet, reflective experiences in nature and draw inspiration from landscapes like the Texas plains and the shores of Puerto Rico.
- I’ve worked in everything from nursing homes to college student services to metal sculpture studios, and I bring a multidisciplinary lens to all my work.
- Outside of coding, I sculpt, weld, paint, garden, dance (West Coast Swing & Fusion!), and make wearable art.

### Philosophy
> “Form follows function — that has been misunderstood. Form and function should be one, joined in a spiritual union.”
> ― Frank Lloyd Wright

Good design isn’t just about performance—it’s about presence. Technology should be compassionate, accessible, and human. The best tools don’t just work; they feel right. They invite reflection, not just interaction. In that sense, form isn’t secondary to function—it’s how function makes itself known.

> “...but more often he would be alone, feeling through a certain quick instinct, which was almost a divination, that the secrets of art are best learned in secret, and that Beauty, like Wisdom, loves the lonely worshiper.”
>  ― Oscar Wilde, The Happy Prince and Other Tales

The most meaningful ideas often begin in silence. Away from noise, distraction, and deadlines, clarity emerges. I believe in starting with stillness—contemplation before construction. But solitude is only the first step.

> “No one is born fully-formed: it is through self-experience in the world that we become what we are.”
>  ― Paulo Freire

I don’t build in a vacuum. The best work happens in dialogue—through feedback, friction, and shared momentum. Every bug fixed by someone else, every idea reshaped by collaboration, is part of that process. I value code review not as critique, but as co-creation.

> “What is the most important thing in the world? It is people, it is people, it is people.”
>  ― Māori proverb

In the end, what matters is who it’s for. My work is guided by a simple principle: build things that serve people. Not markets. Not metrics. People. That belief shapes the tools I design, the teams I join, and the systems I help create.

### Skills & Strengths
While my tech stack reflects the tools I use, my greatest strengths lie in how I approach problems, people, and projects. Here are the skills I bring to every team and codebase:

- **Creative Problem Solving** – I approach challenges with curiosity and persistence, often drawing from diverse disciplines like art, psychology, and fabrication to find thoughtful, human-centered solutions.
- **Collaboration & Communication** – Whether working in teams or mentoring peers, I prioritize clarity, empathy, and active listening. I know how to ask the right questions and how to translate complexity into shared understanding.
- **Project Ownership** – I’m proactive and self-directed. I take initiative, manage my time well, and follow through on tasks with accountability and pride in my work.
- **UI/UX Sensibility** – With a background in visual arts and psychology, I bring a unique perspective to user interfaces, balancing aesthetic design with intuitive functionality and accessibility.
- **Documentation & Organization** – I excel at creating clear, accessible documentation for both codebases and team processes. From README files to team onboarding guides, I bring structure and clarity that helps everyone stay aligned and move faster.
- **Resilience & Adaptability** – I thrive in fast-paced, evolving environments. From learning power tools with zero experience to diving into backend systems mid-project, I meet challenges with resourcefulness and grit.
- **Systems Thinking** – I see the bigger picture — how frontend connects to backend, how users interact with features, and how small design decisions affect the larger system. This helps me build intentional, scalable solutions.
